# Guest users can rejoin a locked group order due to logic flaw

## Description
A logic flaw in the group order access control mechanism allows guest users to rejoin a locked group order using an existing invitation link, even though they previously left. This should not be possible because once a group order is locked, no new participants (including previously removed users) should be able to join, regardless if they are authenticated or guest users.

## Proof Of Concept (PoC)
3 test users would be required (2 authenticated users, 1 guest) to demonstrate the issue:

1. (Auth-UserA) Go to https://redacted.com/en/discovery and select any restaurants (e.g. McDonalds).
2. (Auth-UserA) Create a group order by clicking on the "Order together" button.
3. (Auth-UserA) Share the link to the other users (Auth-UserB) and (Guest-UserC) so they can join the group order.
4. Once Auth-UserB and Guest-UserC have joined the group order, now leave the group order.
5. (Auth-UserA) Lock the group order. Now nobody is able to join the group order as it has been locked.
6. Auth-UserB and Guest-UserC use the same group invitation link from before and notice that Guest-UserC is able to join the group order again but Auth-UserB is not able to. This should not be possible for guests or authenticated users because once a group order is locked, no new participants (including previously removed users) should be able to join.

Expected Behavior: *Once a group order is locked, no new participants(including previously removed users) should be able to join, regardless of their authentication status.*
Actual Behavior: *Authenticated users who leave cannot rejoin a locked group (intended behavior). Guest users who leave can still rejoin using the original invitation link, bypassing the lock restriction (unintended behavior).*

## Impact
1. Guest users can bypass the group lock restriction, violating the intended business logic.
2. The system correctly restricts authenticated users but fails to apply the same rule to guests, leading to inconsistent security behavior.

## Mitigation
Ensure that guest users who leave a group order are restricted similarly to authenticated users and prevented from rejoining once the group is locked.
